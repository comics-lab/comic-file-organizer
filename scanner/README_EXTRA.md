README_EXTRA.md

This file documents the edits performed by the automated assistant and how to run the tests.

Summary of changes

1) scanner.py
- FileInfo dataclass extended with `inode` and `device` fields.
- DirectoryScanner now:
  - uses os.walk(..., followlinks=True) to traverse symlinked directories
  - follows file symlinks when stat'ing files to obtain the target size
  - deduplicates hardlinked files by tracking seen (device, inode) pairs in `self._seen_inodes`
  - tracks seen directories by (device, inode) in `self._seen_dirs` to avoid symlink loops
  - increments `stats['errors']` when file/directory stat fails (e.g., broken symlink)

2) main.py
- added a few type annotations for clarity (interrupted: bool, scanner type hint, signal_handler signature, main() -> int)

3) Tests
- Added pytest tests in `tests/test_scanner_links.py` covering:
  - following symlinked directories
  - hardlink deduplication
  - symlink loop avoidance
  - handling broken symlinks

How to run tests

- Ensure pytest is installed in your environment. If not, install it with pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pytest
```

- Run tests from the project root:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Notes and design decisions

- Symlink traversal: using `followlinks=True` is required to traverse directory symlinks. Because following links can cause cycles, the scanner now tracks directory inodes visited and prunes directories that would revisit the same inode. This prevents infinite loops while still allowing traversal through symlinked trees.

- Hardlinks: files that are hardlinked across the tree are deduplicated by tracking (device, inode). The chosen behavior is to skip subsequent occurrences when the same inode is seen a second time; this keeps totals accurate.

- Broken symlinks: these are handled gracefully â€” stat on a broken symlink raises and increments `stats['errors']`.

- Tests create temporary files and links using `tmp_path` fixture. They will not modify your repository files.

Further improvements (optional)

- Add a CLI flag to control whether to deduplicate hardlinks or to list all file paths referencing the same inode.
- Add verbose/tracing output showing when a directory is skipped due to a symlink loop.
- Add mypy typing and CI configuration to automatically run pytest and mypy.
